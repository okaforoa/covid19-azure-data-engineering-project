## Introduction

Hello, I'm a Data Engineer who recently completed an extensive course on Azure Data Factory, led by Ramesh Retnasamy. This course was a deep dive into the world of data integration and transformation using Azure's robust services, culminating in a practical project on Covid-19 prediction and reporting. Here, I share my experiences, learnings, and outcomes from this transformative learning journey.

## What I Learned

Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience with various Azure services, including Azure Data Factory, SQL Database, Blob Storage, and Data Lake Storage Gen2. Here are the key skills and knowledge areas I explored:

- **Azure Data Factory**: Mastered creating, scheduling, and managing data pipelines for efficient data integration and transformation.
- **Data Integration and Transformation**: Learned how to ingest data from diverse sources and transform it for analytical purposes.
- **Real-World Application**: Applied my knowledge to build a data pipeline for Covid-19 data analysis, focusing on ingestion, processing, and analysis.

## Course Structure and Content

The course was structured to progressively build skills, starting with the basics of Azure Data Factory and advancing to complex data flows and orchestration. Modules covered environment setup, data ingestion, transformation, reporting with Power BI, and concluded with best practices in CI/CD for DevOps integration.

## Capstone Project: Covid-19 Prediction and Reporting

The highlight of the course was the capstone project where I applied my new skills to build a comprehensive data solution for Covid-19 prediction and reporting. This project involved:

- **Data Ingestion**: Sourced Covid-19 data from various public APIs and repositories.
- **Data Transformation**: Processed and transformed the data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Analysis and Reporting**: Utilized Azure SQL Database and Power BI to analyze the data and build insightful reports.

## My Experience and Outcomes

Engaging with this course was both challenging and rewarding. Not only did I expand my technical skills, but I also developed a deeper understanding of how data can be leveraged to address real-world issues, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The practical, hands-on approach helped solidify my learning, and completing the capstone project gave me a tangible application of my skills.

## Conclusion

Completing this course has been a significant step in my journey as a data professional. I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to build and manage complex data integration and transformation projects using Azure Data Factory. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in advancing their capabilities in data engineering and analytics.
